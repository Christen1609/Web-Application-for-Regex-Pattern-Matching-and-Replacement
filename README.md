# Web-Application-for-Regex-Pattern-Matching-and-Replacement
A web app that converts natural language input received from users into regex to transform CSV/Excel data. Upload a file, describe a pattern (e.g., "match phone numbers"), and apply regex-based replacements to selected columns. The app was built with Django, React, and OpenAI. Supports previewing and downloading the transformed data.
